I hope this package to be usefull for analyse of signals that leave on
the surface of a sphere. Even though it has been designed for wavelet 
analysis the code is sufficiently general to be used for a wider 
class of functions than just wavelets. Refer to tutorials directory 
for some examples on how to use it.

Spherical harmonic calculations are now available too.

Please, mail me if you have any comments. I will apreciate any
feedback on this.
